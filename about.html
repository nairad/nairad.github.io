        <div id='about-text'><p>Pictobaby is a reading game that employs the technology of the Makey Makey to teach kids how to read and
                                recognize everyday words. It's easy to set up and even easier to play!</p></div>
        <div id='how-it-works-title'><h2>How it works</h2></div>
        <div id='how-it-works'><p>The Makey Makey connects to any laptop
            and acts like your keyboard. The only difference is that
            it can recieve input from... two pieces of Play-Doh! <br> Your 
            child sees an image and two words, colored differently, on the 
            computer screen. In front of them is the Makey Makey, attached 
            to which are two pieces of Play-Doh, in corresponding colors to 
            the words on screen. Only one word matches the image, and your child selects which 
            one they think it is by pressing the piece of Play-Doh that 
            corresponds to their answer. It's as easy as that!</p></div>
